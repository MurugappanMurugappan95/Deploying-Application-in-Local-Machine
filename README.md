# Deploying-Application-in-Local-Machine
Another way of deploying application in local server/ machine to understand the concept of web server and making local machine as web server

# To understand the web server, we can use our laptop to run as local machine/ server and displaying the list of files and folders in any particular location in the local server and that can be accessed using localhost in the default port of 8000

# copy the html of any application and using that, create a file as index.html and saved in the same location where we are trying to launch the application in the local machine/ server
